# Sydney_Str
Sydney Str is a simple frame analysis programme written in Fortran 90 as a part of my Structural Analysis project.
Since I wrote it as a Quick Win application, unfortunately it is MS Windows only. For the multi-platform release, refer to Sydney Str Console version.

Directions on how to use the programme can be found in the Manual directory.
